# Plot.ly Challenge

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Plotly

* The D3 library was used to read in `samples.json`.

* A horizontal bar chart was created with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* A bubble chart that displays each sample was created along with a card displaying the individuals metadata. 

## Deployment

* The app is deployed to a free static page hosting service, GitHub Pages.
